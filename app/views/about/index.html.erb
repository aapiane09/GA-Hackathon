        <h5>It can be daunting to go to a meetup or a Hackathon with people who have
          been in the industry for years when you are just starting out. Here at General
          Assembly we have seen this be an issue. We aim to provide a space area where
          we all can test our skills and push each other to grow and learn as much as
          possible! In doing so, we have created General Assembly specific Hackathons!
          These hackathons are geared towards individuals who are still learning or alumni
          who would like to help others learn.</h5>

          <h5>The function of educating is to teach one to think intensively and to
            think critically. Intelligence plus character- that is the goal of true
            education. Not only is our goal to build character, our aim to built vital
            skills to a professional level. We want to provide an area where individuals
            can practice their skills without the feeling of being left behind or not
            being able to contribute anything. In doing so, you will be
            about to challenge yourself as well as boosting your portfolio!</h5>
